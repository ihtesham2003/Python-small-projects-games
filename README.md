Hey, Gitties,

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of
the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
secret number.

The Program in Action
When you run bagels.py, the output will look like this:

I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say:
That means:
Pico
One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
Fermi
One digit is correct and in the right position.
Bagels
No digit is correct.
I have thought up a number.
You have 10 guesses to get it.
Guess #1:
> 123
Pico
Guess #2:
> 456
Bagels
Guess #3:
> 178
Pico Pico
--snip--
Guess #7:
> 791
Fermi Fermi
Guess #8:
> 701
You got it!
Do you want to play again? (yes or no)
> no
Thanks for playing!
